so_long. Great project, terrible 2D graphic library that made me wanna kill myself I genuinely wanna know how this will run shit like miniRT and cub3D
I heard mlx is getting a well needed update for the projects (making it cross-compatible and hopefully patching its racism towards funny based penguin OS)
